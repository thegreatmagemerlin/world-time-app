# World Time App

My first flutter project

## Getting Started

This app is a basic flutter app that will show the times in different countries. It takes data from the worldtimeapi.org website and has three different pages that it cycles through. It can only search countries from the countries that it has been programmed to. Functionality is currently fully operational in the app and does not have any known bugs.
